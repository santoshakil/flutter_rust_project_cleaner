# Flutter Rust Project Cleaner - Enterprise Features

## What We've Built

An enterprise-grade, production-ready CLI tool that's a complete rewrite of the original simple script. This tool provides professional features for cleaning Flutter and Rust projects at scale.

## Key Enterprise Features

### 1. Robust Architecture
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Type-safe error handling with custom error types
- Builder pattern for configuration
- Parallel processing with Rayon
- Async/await for concurrent operations

### 2. Professional CLI Interface
- Subcommand architecture (clean, list, config)
- Comprehensive argument parsing with clap
- Shell completion support
- Environment variable support
- Configuration file management

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Dry-run mode**: Preview changes without executing
- **Interactive mode**: Select specific projects to clean
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time feedback with progress bars
- **Colored output**: Enhanced terminal experience
- **Filtering**: By project type, include/exclude patterns
- **Parallelism control**: Configurable concurrent operations
- **Space estimation**: Shows how much space will be freed

### 4. Safety and Reliability
- Confirmation prompts before cleaning
- Graceful error handling
- Permission checking
- Command availability verification
- Atomic operations

### 5. Enterprise Configuration
- TOML configuration files
- User-specific settings
- Default configuration initialization
- Configuration editing support

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- Parallel directory scanning
- Concurrent project cleaning
- Efficient space calculation
- Minimal memory footprint
- Optimized release builds

### 7. Developer Experience
- Comprehensive logging system
- Multiple verbosity levels
- Quiet mode for automation
- JSON output for machine parsing
- Detailed error messages

### 8. Testing and CI/CD
- Unit and integration tests
- Cross-platform CI with GitHub Actions
- Automated release pipeline
- Code coverage reporting
- Multiple target builds

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic cleaning
frpc clean /path/to/projects

# Dry run to see what would be cleaned
frpc clean /path/to/projects --dry-run

# Interactive selection
frpc clean /path/to/projects --interactive

# Clean only Flutter projects
frpc clean /path/to/projects -t flutter

# Custom parallelism
frpc clean /path/to/projects -j 8

# List projects without cleaning
frpc list /path/to/projects --json

# Initialize configuration
frpc config init

# Generate shell completions
frpc completions bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/frpc
```

## Architecture Highlights

- **Error Module**: Custom error types with thiserror
- **Project Module**: Detection and metadata collection
- **Scanner Module**: Parallel filesystem traversal
- **Cleaner Module**: Concurrent cleaning operations
- **Config Module**: CLI and configuration management
- **Utils Module**: Logging and interactive utilities

## Production Ready Features

- Comprehensive error handling
- Graceful degradation
- Resource management
- Signal handling
- Cross-platform support
- Performance optimizations
- Security considerations

This tool is now enterprise-ready and can handle large-scale project cleaning operations with professional features and reliability.
